## Game of life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.[1] It is a zero-player game,[2][3] meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

## Installing & How to

### Play

> 'Left  mouse click' add cell.


> 'Right mouse click' remove cell. 


> 'Space Bar' to run & pause the simulation.

### starting Configuration

> You can use directly the Custom Injector by giving an array of cells.

> Otherwise, you can use the Auto injector by giving him a file image.

> You can add multiple patterns for more information see 
> https://copy.sh/life/examples/
